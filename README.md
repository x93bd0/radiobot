# RadioBot
RadioBot is a simple [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot, for playing audio on [Telegram Voice Chats](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats). Right now it's in alpha development phase, and it's expected to continue in this state for at least 1 month.

# Features
The bot itself is coded following [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle, trying to get simplicity (and by consequence efficiency) over features.
1. Normal player commands (/play, /stop, /next, /pause, /resume, /volume)
2. Ability to play audio on channels (WIP)
3. Whitelist for admins to allow non-admin people to take control over the bot commands (WIP)

That's all the bot has to offer for now. Probably it will grow over time.

# Dependencies
This project wouldn't be possible if [pytgcalls](https://github.com/pytgcalls/pytgcalls) didn't exist, it's a great library for making "radiobot's". Also [pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) fits in the same situation, it's great for making Telegram Bots in general.

# That's all for now, stay tuned for more updates on [my channel](https://t.me/x93dev)
